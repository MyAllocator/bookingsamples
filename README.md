# bookingsamples

Example JSON files for myallocator bookings for each channel supported.

## What is this?

If you're developing a PMS for myallocator right now you probably are dealing with the booking import. Each channel provides a different set of data which we try to make as consistent as possible. In order for you to support all the different fields that different channels provide we offer these JSON dumps of bookings by channel so that you can test with those.

## Are those real bookings?

They are as close to real bookings as possible without including personal information details.

## How often are the examples updates?

There is currently no schedule for this.
